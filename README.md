wigglyworm
==========
In this simple arcade game, players step into the shoes (err, segments?) of Timmy the Tapeworm, a lamentably misunderstood nematode battling for survival against an every-growing army of antibiotics. Using the mouse, players must steer Timmy (who is made up of several linked springs) away from the death-dealing antibiotics (balls). The longer that Timmy evades the antibiotics, the more points he accrues. However, the antibiotics gradually accelerate and multiply in number – and Timmy gradually grows longer – making survival progressively more difficult. Timmy can also snack on tasty green nutrients (squares) to gain bonus points.
